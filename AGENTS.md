Always build what you did to validate the code (ie. that there is no compilation error)
Use swiftlint to verify the quality of your code.
Make sure that your functions do just one thing. Refactor if it's not the case.
Write unit tests for your code, and run them when before considering the code complete.
Use the ./cli shell script to run the compile, lint, test commands; update it if needed.
